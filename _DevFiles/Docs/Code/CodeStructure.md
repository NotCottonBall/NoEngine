# Headers
Headers will have the extension `.h` in NoEngine.

# The Include Structure
Every `.h` in NoEngien that should be exported to the User should be placed in the the `Include/` dir.\
The structure of this Include folder should be the same as the namespaces.

Example:
- The file **Engine.h** is in the namespace **NoEngine** so the Include structure should look like this:\
`PROJECT_ROOT/NoEngine/Include/NoEngine/Engine.h`
